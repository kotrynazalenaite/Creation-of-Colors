# Creation-of-Colors
In this simulation, I'm exploring the RGB color model, where colors are created by adjusting the intensities of Red, Green, and Blue. By mixing these colors, I can create new ones, like Yellow, Cyan, or White. It helps me understand how colors blend and how digital screens use this model to display images.
